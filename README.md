# SQL Queries Project

## Overview

Welcome to my SQL Queries Project repository! This project demonstrates my ability to write and optimize complex SQL queries to extract valuable insights from databases. Each query is designed to address specific business questions and provide actionable insights.

## Project Highlights

- **Customer Market Analysis**: Identify markets in the APAC region for a specific customer.
- **Unique Product Increase Analysis**: Calculate the percentage increase in unique products between 2020 and 2021.
- **Segment Product Count Report**: Generate a report of unique product counts for each segment.
- **Segment Increase Analysis**: Determine which segment had the most increase in unique products between 2020 and 2021.
- **Manufacturing Costs Report**: Find products with the highest and lowest manufacturing costs.
- **Discount Analysis**: Report on top customers with the highest average discount percentage in 2021, specifically in India.
- **Gross Sales Report**: Analyze gross sales amount for a specific customer across months.
- **Quarterly Sales Analysis**: Identify the quarter in 2020 with the maximum total sold quantity.
- **Sales Channel Analysis**: Determine which sales channel contributed the most to gross sales in 2021 and its percentage contribution.


## Running the SQL Queries

To run the SQL queries provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: 
   - Ensure you have access to the database where the relevant tables are located (e.g., `dim_customer`, `sales`, and `products`).

2. **Open SQL Client**:
   - Use MySQL Workbench, command line, or any other SQL client you prefer.

3. **Load Queries**:
   - You can copy and paste the individual queries from this repository or load the `reportalluniqueprod.sql` file directly if available.

4. **Execute Each Query**:
   - Select the query you wish to run and execute it. Make sure to run queries one at a time to observe the results and understand the insights derived from each query.
